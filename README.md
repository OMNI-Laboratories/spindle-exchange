Liquidity Pool Smart Contracts

## Instillation

```shell
npm install
```

## Running Tests

Contracts that are used for testing should be labeled with the `Test` prefix. Those that are representative of a live contract, but are augmented for easier tested should be labeled with the `Mock` prefix.

To get started, all you should need to install dependencies and run the unit tests are here.

```shell
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
```
